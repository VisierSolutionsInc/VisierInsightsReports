### Summary
While late May and early June showed upward trends for employee turnover and hiring, new data reveals that the increase in COVID-19 cases had a direct impact on market confidence for both individuals and companies. Unlike the initial wave of cases, where the seriousness of the pandemic took time to sink in, reactions to the resurgence have been quick and dramatic, erasing almost all gains from the previous month of reopening. The Visier Insights database, comprising over seven million employee records from more than 100 large companies, reveals how different age and gender groups are reacting to the new outbreaks.
